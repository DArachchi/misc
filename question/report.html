</tr>
<tr>
<td>Setup tool (integrated into the UI or a command line command) that helps to get started more easily and less time-consuming for beginners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Generally, the ease of configuring Keycloak and Realms, and persisting this configuration outside of keycloak (source control, CI/CD stack etc). Injectable configuration for running in Docker under different environments (Dev, Test, Prod etc). Realm import is flaky (some things can be imported, other things can't?) Some realm config settings are environment independent, and some change with environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>France Connect federation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- Ability to authenticate users via Kerberos and then look them up in LDAP based on some attribute (krbPrincipalName) instead of assuming that principal == uid
- FIDO U2F support
- Handling FreeIPA-integrated OTP in two-step fashion, just like built-in OTP (but I believe this would require changes on FreeIPA side)
- Extending Keycloak in Python ;-)</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nothing aside from configuration necessary to work with LDAP and clients.  We do use custom templates for logins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nothing significant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We have needed to cluster on TCP with NATed addresses, otherwise we use mostly the standard configuration in standalone-ha.xml.  For authentication flows we use our own providers, due to internal requirements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not yet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When running local development we disable theme caching and change the HTTP port to another port in the Docker container. It would be nice to be able to have those as environment variable options instead of having to edit the standalone.xml every release.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Federation/User Storage Provider completely replaces the internal Keycloak user/roles/password management. The Email Provider has been customized in order to support the messaging for the dual authentication flow (LDAP and legacy company database) provided by the Federation/User Storage Provider. The syncrhonization of the roles from the User Storage Provider to the Keycloak Roles management is not performed during the login in order to avoid some very critical Oracle deadlock in case of concurrent login, but it provided by one asyncronous job that runs inside Keycloak using Quartz.
From Adapter point of view, the standard way to retrieve and manage the  Keycloak realm .json files into the backend has been replaced by an heavy customized PathKeycloakResolver that is able to manage a real multitenancy in the proper way. 
The Kerberos Provider has been customized in order to work together with the company authentication database.
There are some other customizazions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No not much</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Just theming mainly. It would be nice to be able to easily modify the email templates as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yes we have our realms </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. we do not provide any default installation. it is part of install step to tune them</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yes, Disabling HTTP, force HTTPS. Saving events. Enabled I18n.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Browser Flow, Direct Grant Flow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- We use tcp-unicast for infinispan clustering, since keycloak nodes are running in different subnets which don't allow multicast</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yes. We've automated the creation of realms with custom clients/roles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JGroups configuration</td>
</tr>

<h2>Customizations</h2>
<div class="maxheight">

<td>just for the time a bugfix is not present</td>

<tr>
<td>Using overlays </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I really like working with code and contribute code sometimes to several projects, but I do not modify or add code to security and critical applications as keycloak in fear of breaking something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extend of docker image to incluse custom module</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A couple custom SPIs, javascript based auth flow and json freemarker template.  We also had to get a little clever with how we do role naming, since our application requires the use of composite roles, but with some special requirements. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Used to do more, but recent versions offer pretty much all I need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>we run custom builds with minor patches to fix immediate KC issues, and have 101 custom Java files under spi-extensions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We heavily override some parts of code in the java servlet adapter to match our needs. We don't do any modifications to Keycloak itself</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We are running a fork of the Spring Boot adapter that is modified to support cookie token storage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No, did some commits recently but one of them should be discussed with the community</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No (no need yet)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We did when we were experimenting, but not for real use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We have as a guiding policy avoided forking Keycloak.  And when bugs have affected our use of it, patches have been readily accepted into the standard code base, alleviating any need for maintaining our own version of the basic product.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not yet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Using https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/pull/100 to run clustered in Kubernetes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No need to fork the code. Some providers, like the Email Provider, have been inherited and ovverrided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not currently, haven't found a need to do so as of yet. If I do and it's not a niche scenario, I'll push the code back upstream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Just because of private methods or bugs (for example cache bug)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not yet - I'd be delighted by a well-made intro/startup for new developers to get a KC development env up and running. Please excuse me if that exists already and I just overlooked it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Only the docker image</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- We needed a way to create users without email addresses to integrate data from legacy system
- Needed to allow users to remove their email address
- Needed to add realm name to subject parameters for emails
- Needed to allow user search by userId in admin-console
- Integration of custom 2FA based on hardware otp generators</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nope, only custom providers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- Created a Session limitor
- Login page / UsernamePasswordForm - to allow for a simple message to be set from the system admin
- DisclaimerRequiredAction - forces people to accept a disclaimer before logging in.
- Prior to the X509 being built in, developed an identity provider that read the cert and linked it to an account based on the cert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yes, plugins and patch, have done an accepted PR one time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WE have a x509 plugin suited to our needs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yes, but generally we don't fork due to it being a monorepo. If adapters were individual projects we would be more apt to fork and pr changes to the spring related adapters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I've started to look at how to package Keycloak as an RPM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Just one place, I don't remember now</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Custom code to handle a very complex hierarchical role/permissions model for a specific project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Our Authentication SPI is based on existing code to make Kerberos authentication conditional (to avoid offering it to hosts not joined to our FreeIPA, as this may trigger IWA login dialog on IE and Chrome under Windows) and lookup LDAP users by krbPrincipalName attribute (to handle cross-realm trusts). We've also modified SAML2 POST redirect page to show ""You are being redirected, please wait..."" instead of blank page.</td>

I do not know if you know anything about timing, so I'll try to explain it in a few simple words, although you can look at the websites of companies that provide timing tools such as Chronotrack or Mylaps, which are sure to explain it better.
I tell you, the athletes have placed a passive disposable chip stuck on the bib that identifies them. At several control points, antennas or mants are placed that activate the chip when it passes over it. The chip responds with a signal and the system records the moment in which that signal has been produced (in fact it is more complex, but in a simple way it is like that).
We are connected in a network with the timing system that sends us the time of passage of the chip, we process that chip and that time to assign it to an athlete and we publish on our web page the passage of the athlete. We also publish it in our mobile app and make a publication on the athlete's wall on facebook and twitter (previously they must have registered, of course).
This system is complemented by an enrollment platform and an exclusive application for managing the profile of the athlete where they can see the results in all events, they can upload the documents needed to register for an event (medical certificate, parental permission, etc.).
We use keycloak to access the registration portal and profile management.

We have recently added another product to our system (www.pul-sos.com, although the web is not yet fully translated into English yet). It is a bracelet that athletes (or any other person, we have in fact provided coverage to an Alzheimer's disease association) for their safety. It is a silicone bracelet that has a unique QR code engraved. The athletes enter their profile and can incorporate the medical or emergency data they want.
In case of accident, loss or any circumstance in which the person is not able to respond, the paramedics (or anyone who can help them) can read the QR and a page with all the data of the person is presented. Here they can indicate previous illnesses, allergies, contact persons, etc.
The access to this portal for managing the profile and all the data that the user wants to appear when someone reads the QR is controlled by keycloak.</td>

<td>The good : Quite easy to implement, the ldap connector is very flexible. The less good : would love a repository for easier install/upgrade. The cas protocol is really missing and still heavily used by most of our apps, i use the cas plugin found on github, works well and should be integrated in the product.
More flexibility with kerberos auth to avoid popups with external users/computers (exception with ip ranges or user agent as MS ADFS does), i have to implement this with apache headers manipulation.

In the actual version of Keycloak there are many functions that we do not use, although being able to have a theme in the client and not the real level has been for us the last best contribution. Even now we have incorporated the possibility of authentication with X509 certificates.
The bad part was the beginning, because the learning curve is not trivial. But now, all projects that need authentication are based Keycloak.
The best part is undoubtedly the ease of use for our users and the ability to tunning the theme for each project in a simple way. </td>

<td>We are primarily using Keycloak to provide the Oauth2/OIDC authentication functionality for our microservice platform. We are not using it as the main repo of our user base, but only as a shadow of our user store in order authenticate users and provide bearer tokens, so we have implemented a few customizations in order to support our needs.  

Probably our most useful customization is that since our user interface is a React-based SPA, the requirement to do full-page redirects when authenticating a user is really antithetical to how an SPA needs to function. Not only does it require page changes, but is really limiting from a design and branding perspective since our customers will not have access to the keycloak server to customize themes. It also seems a little circa 2003. So I implemented a custom freemarker-based theme that returns json instead of the html. This allows our SPA to be able to better use and control that flow of data from Keycloak while still handling the redirects as needed and our customers will be able to implement their own UI designs without having to make changes to the Keycloak server.  A suggested enhancement would be to have an option to return actual json rather than having to shoehorn it into a freemarker templates.

Additionally, we support SMS based 2fa and because of the aforementioned use of an SPA, all of our multifactor support has to happen within our SPA, so we cannot use any of the Keycloak multifactor features since they are so ingrained with the redirect-based authentication flow. 

We are using many Keycloak realms to support our multi-tenant needs and Keycloak clients to represent our high level resources.  I think the most challenging thing about Keycloak is that many of the features related to clients and authentication flows are not very intuitive and took a lot of work to understand just how they function and their limitations. We also tried to user the authorization features of Keycloak for resource protection, but we found them to be rather limiting and not at all friendly to use.   So we only use Keycloak for user role assignments and then do the authorization of roles-based access externally, currently using Apiman with a custom plugin for supporting finer grained permissions. The authorization aspects of Keycloak while broad still feel very 1.0ish and not very useful. 

I do appreciate the availability  of the javascript-based authentication module. Though I have built some custom SPIs, the availability of the script module has dramatically increased our efficiency and flexibility for being able to quickly make changes. Two suggestions for that script module would be to allow access to the HTTP response so that we can set our own application cookies or other custom headers and it would be great if there were built in objects to make restful calls from within the script that could be integrated with the Keycloak  authentication functionality for passing bearer tokens, etc. At the moment, that all has to be done using custom javascript which is tedious and prone to error, but it seems like such a waste to not be able to take advantage of all of the Resteasy functionality that already exists under the covers.</td>

<td>It was pretty easy to start playing around with Keycloak because of how easy it is to just set up a standalone instance. We use the Java servlet adapter, which also works out of the box making it easy to see results fast.

I think the admin GUI is easy to understand, and easy to use, and the import functionality build in is very helpful. Especially in our case where our applications are white labeled and we have to create very similar realms whenever a new white label is added.

Working with the admin REST API was not great. I feel like the API is not well documented, and the behaviour is sometimes not predictable. There are also cases where the format of returned errors is randomly different, making it hard to handle these.

A more recent issue we ran into is using internationalization with Keycloak. While this functionality works, it's difficult to integrate when your application doesn't use the user management functionality in Keycloak. So if a user decides to change the language on our application, there is not much we can do to actually let Keycloak know. We can use the REST API, but that doesn't help because the KC_LOCALE cookie will still be set, meaning the change will be undone when the user logs in again.</td>

<tr>
<td>Relatively easy to set up, even if the documentation is a bit patchy in places. It was very easy to migrate user accounts from Stormpath to Keycloak. Good standards compliance. Dramatically bad Spring integration, that cost us a _lot_ of extra work because it was not mentioned in the docs that a lot of configuration has absolutely no effect in the Spring adapter (most notably cookie support, which we relied on heavily due to how our previous setup in Stormpath was done).</td>

<td>The Good - Out of the box solution which met enterprise federated authentication needs. We have customized Keycloak solutions running on Helion OpenStack and AWS. Responsive OSS community. 
The Bad - Documentation was not exhaustive during 1.x releases. Many use cases were figured out by trial and error. Especially SAML configurations while integrating with 3rd party services. No easy way to search through mailing list to see if others have faced similar issues. Its 2018 - Keycloak needs a forum or Stack Exchange!</td>

<td>The good part of keycloak is that it allows me to secure my applications without to much work and it uses standards like oauth2, openid etc. But there are some bad parts , for example I'd like to use keycloak on  java JMS, java websockets but there isn't official support for it. Besides, maybe the most recurrent problem I have to face is that most of my software projects work in the same way that JBOSS APIMAN works; I mean my projects usually have organizations and I have to give different roles or scopes in different organizations using the same realm. Is not easy to abstract that, and like Apiman I usually create my own roles In a different database. Maybe there are other ways but that's what I usually do. </td>

So for login I wish it were a bit faster under stress but understand why it is the way it is. Also maybe update the login and profile front - end with an SPA instead of full pages with some AJAX.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We have particularly enjoyed the fast development pace of Keycloak, and how easy it is to extend with new login and onboarding mechanisms.  We have complex requirements for integration with external identity providers.  This requires refinements to the default ""authentication flows"" provided by Keycloak.  And such refinements are very easy to add and verify (albeit with a ""private"" SPI library).

We have also found that having an opensource product simplifies error resolution, and have occasionally been able to provide patches accepted into the Keycloak project faster than a COTS product would have responded.  This simplifies the product management on our end.

The availability of Keycloak / Wildfly is very good.  Over two years, no outages have been caused by failures in the core components.

Off course, the rapid development leads to one of Keycloak's ""cons"".  Burst implementation before deadlines sometimes introduces unnecessary bugs, for instance in PKCE and tab sessions.  These have been resolved quite quickly, though.

Cluster management and High Availability also feels too complicated, and has so far caused the most anxiety during production upgrades.  As we use Keycloak as a standalone product, we would like it as decoupled from Wildfly as possible, with standard configurations suited for Keycloak as the only deployment.  Maybe with a ""keycloak.conf"" type file?
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My experience with Keycloak is good. I think the best is that is opensource and we can connect our own database. It's easy to configure. Therefore, It seems not easy to change login template like mobile modern app, and remove fields to registration. In most mobile app we have email, password and confirm password as fields. So with keycloak you have to make some development. Another thing is that I use MongoDB (in local and with Mongo Atlas). I don't know how managing that in prod.
Is there a way to use auth API with JS applications? To avoid to change templates.</td>

<tr>
<td>The good: Keycloak is pretty simple in its usage and integration. Many updates with so many useful features. The bad: testing framework is not available for us and as we developed our own identity provider we can't test it easily. ""entrypoint"" (ways of implementing new feature) are sometimes tough to reach, full copy of a class just to add a line. Adapters need some new features.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Good:
- Good documentation for understanding basic concepts of Keycloak. Doesn't need to be an openid-connect expert before diving-in to keycloak and getting to work.
- Actively processing pull requests, even for documentation repository
- Open source, source code is easy to find & trace.
- Responsive mailing list.

Bad:
- Lack of documentation on how to get information from token for nodejs adapter. (Maybe I should make a PR later?)
- Javascript adaptor & nodejs adaptor swallows too many exceptions - they are simply caught and not re-thrown. Developers cannot handle token validation failure, cannot catch on the case when keycloak server is down, and so on.</td>

<tr>
<td>+ nice working software
+ easy to integrate (using Spring[boot] mostly)
+ easy to migrate legacy SW to KC
+ primary use cases pretty obvious
- the state of the documentation leaves much to be desired and has been mentioned in a number of posts/blogs
- not up-to-date with current version (3.4.3 refuses to export all 'secrets' for migration - no clue how to get around that)
- google indexes are swamped with no-longer-existing and old and duplicate documentation locations
- the general tone of the documentation is light and easy as if almost anything is almost trivial to do. One or two examples (which are really trivial) an from then on one is left in the dark. This is particularly true for API calls of all sorts (...that I came in contact with so far :-), but also for interactive configuration:
- I am missing a concise list of which KC-defined roles for its various clients allow a user to do exactly what (or prevent her to do something)
- and lots more

The user interface and documentation around fine-grained admin permissions and policies scores 11 out of 10 in providing an incredibly frustrating user experience. The GUI exposes a maximum of complexity from the underlying implementation, without giving sufficient information to handle the complexity. UUIDs, for instance, are great internally, but in most of the places they are used (in fine-grained), for a user they are obscure references into the void (not searchable afterwards). Please try to attract GUI- and interaction designers to re-do this interface!
This pattern also affects other parts of the GUI: The event log lists UUIDs of users (instead of their names, perhaps even linking to that user ...), but one cannot *search* in the user window for their UUID. So: search with the browser page by page. But wait: the UUID on the page is abbreviated. So one has to delete the appropriate number of characters from the UUID 'harvested' from the event log. :-(

- Why is it so difficult to find out which users have a specific role/group? 'Users in Role' only lists users having that role *directly assigned*. Composite Roles, Groups or composite groups are not considered.
Effective roles in the User page (in a tiny space without search capability) list all the roles. But what if I encounter a Role this user should not have any more? There is no way to find out the (potentially multiple) paths this Role reaches this user (how about a list showing up hovering over the role?)

<td>Is works. Great SSO. Poor documentation to customize it. My question hasn't been responded in the forum.</td>

<tr>
<td>Pros:
- It is very easy to get started with Keycloak. 
- User / Admin Documentation is a great help.
- The provided examples (keycloak-quickstarts) make it easy to adapt Keycloak to own applications.
- Keycloak is quite robust and runs without problems in production

Cons:
- SPIs and APIs has very little documentation, which makes it quite difficult to build correct custom integrations.
- The admin console is missing a global / client role overview. In the admin-console alone it is hard to find out which users have a particular set of roles. One needs to query the Keycloak database for this.
-  Customizing Keycloak with the CLI is doable but quite cumbersome. It would be great if there was something like a ""Keycloak distribution generator"" where a user could select database vendor, url, (except secrets) etc., desired infinispan clustering approach  (multicast, tcpunicast etc.) - similar to start.spring.io.
- Currently there is AFAIK no official recommendation about how to structure a Keycloak integration project. Would be great to give some recommendations about structuring a Keycloak integration project.
Most of the time companies will use stock Keycloak + custom theme + (custom extensions) which are either built into dedicated artifacts that are combined during deployment, or packaged as one big artifact or docker image.
We're using a combined approach where we have a dedicated keycloak-acme Project that includes the stock Keycloak server and adds themes and a set of custom providers in one build and produces one big artifact / docker image.
- Realm Import / Export story is not great. When trying to transfer a dev environment to staging/prod it is most of the time quite cumbersome to transfer the settings.
- When a Keycloak instance is upgraded, old realm configurations keep their old configuration - which is a good thing in general to avoid breaking something... but some settings, like e.g. the default Web Security Headers which changed over time, stay at the old stored (default) value which is potentially insecure by now. It would be great if Keycloak would be able to detect such ""insecure"" defaults from older versions and recommend to use the new (default) settings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Nice : good implementation of OpenId connect, easily customizable with plugins, many parameters and functionalities that help us to adapt to each security policy. Reactive team !
Bad: not so much ! One main problem is how plugins can modify Angular admin application, some js must be patched and rebased on each release, it can be a pain. Discussing with gravitee.io, also using keycloak, they have an interesting DSL describing UI and a dynamically generated angular UI (maybe they ask for that to Sebastien Blanc).</td>

<tr>
<td>Much of it is good. But, we have had a lot of difficulty with the mono-repo nature of the project. Spring related adapter integrations have had many small bugs and forking+patching+pr'ing is avoided because it's a bit arduous to contribute when the entire codebase for everything is in one repo. We have a lot of issues and problems trying to support 2 major versions of spring boot runtimes with the underlying adapter not able to adapt to that use. Also, there have been a fair number of workarounds we've had to implement to avoid problems with shared httpsession storage using Spring-Session and redis. A core theme of incompatibility is optimizations made by SpringRedisSessionRepository and keycloak classes being transient and not repopulated correctly on deserialization from the distributed store.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Good and easy integration in application stacks, better administration tools</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The good:
We have been following the project since 2015 as an implementation of OpenID Connect IDP. We stayed because of the extra features: User management (registration, forgot password, identity broker, etc).
The first product to use Keycloak was Akvo Lumen and the integration using the JavaScript adapter was easy and straight forward.
The bad:
* We understand that this is a community driven project and that RedHat packages and distributes RH-SSO, but not patching security issues it's a big handicap for organization with small budgets. 
* We had lots of expectations on Authorization services, but at the time we evaluated it (1 year ago) non of the existing APIs (UMA and Entitlement) served our needs. UMA was too 'chatty' and entitlement meant sending huge payloads as HTTP authorization headers.</td>

<td>- Excellent feature set
- Low on resource consumption

- Documentation of options in UI (e.g., various LDAP sync settings) is sorely lacking
- Postgresql database connection is not smart enough to reconnect when the SQL server is restarted; seems to require a restart of Wildfly entirely</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The documentation is excellent, the source code is available and there are many examples in the net.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Overall the experience has been very fruitful, being able to deprecated bespoke implementations and get our teams / project standardized on a reusable pattern.

- Initial issues revolved around the tenancy requirements, though perhaps now sorted with UMA and console permissions, because in a realm you were either and admin or not we ended up having to use many realms per project, which lend  to a users sprawl. 

- The administration for groups could use improvements, as assuming we were to reuse a realm, a single group section across multiple clients / projects would be impossible to manage. One idea would be much like roles which can be realm or client, we could do the same with groups.

- It would be nice to have a few more how-to around using the Authentication Flows. Around scripting and the extent we could customize? How could i say, if you don't have from this ip range, you must MFA? How do a throw out an log when a user is created? Can you block someone from continuing authentication if they don't have a particular role (at Keycloak, rather then client)? .. 
 
- Logging and auditing needs some improvement, it's difficult to workout what user has made the change and what the change was exactly. 

- Some form of on-boarding / approval process for users. 

- Provide some metrics on the internals (statsd, jmx, perhasp prometheus), but essentially instrumentation so we can alert or provide insight on.</td>

- was not able to activate GSS credential delegation
- sometimes SAML2 post-auth redirection (JavaScript-sent POST form) gets stuck at blank page for a few seconds, which is a bit confusing for users
- (not really an issue with Keycloak) it's not easy to retrofit SAML2/OpenID Connect support to some older apps (and sometimes builtin support for SSO is a crap)</td>

It just seems like it is designed for old school authentication needs and harder to use with more modern application architectures, despite all of the customization abilities.
